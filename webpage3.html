				<h2>Overworld</h2>
				<p style="color:white; text-align:left;">
				The main part of the game is spent in the overworld view of the map. Here players can see their own land, settlements, cities, and armies along with 
				the enemies'. The map is divided into several provinces, each province contains up to 4 regions with settlements in each region. There is 
				one big settlement in each province along with 0-3 extra smaller settlements in the province as well. Here the player can manage their empire,
				armies, and others. Settlements have from 4-12 building slots which can be used to build buildings, each of which have many effects and 
				properties. Technology and diplomacy are available to the player. Each region has terrain and climate, which can affect army movement and 
				habitability of settlements. 
				</p>
				<h2>Battlefield</h2>
				<p style="color:white; text-align:left;">
				One of the main highlights of the gameplay are the battles. The battles take place in real time on many variable maps. Maps can include all manner
				of terrain and be simple land battles, siege battles, underground battles, and even island battles at sea. There is a time limit for the battles
				usually 60 minutes, however some special battles have a time limit short than that. Battles are not limited to 1v1, reinforcement armies which trickle 
				in slowly from different parts of the map may join. You can control your own stack of 20 units, however if you wish you can also control
				a large army of 40 units creating truly epic battles. Siege battles offer attackers a challenge by having them attack a fortified position,
				attackers can build siege engines to help, however they may already have monsters and other untis capable of besieging a settlement in their 
				army.
				</p>
				<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
				<p style="color:white; text-align:left;">
				Throughout the game you will encounter many other factions, hostile or otherwise. All factions have an opinion of you, ranging from -999 to 999.
				This affects diplomacy options as factions who do not like you will be unwilling to negotiate. The opinion modifier can be affected by many things. 
				From the diplomacy tab you can make trade agreements, non-aggression pacts, defensive alliances, military alliances, and more. You can even
				try and confederate with another faction, joining forces.
				</p>
				<h2>Rituals</h2>
				<p style="color:white; text-align:left;">
				Throughout the main campaign the overarching plot line are the 4 races trying to claim the vortex. They will do this by enacting rituals, there are 
				5 of them and they require a special resource. Lizardmen require ancient plaques, high elves require way-fragments, dark elves require scrolls
				of Hekarti, and skaven need warpstone. Each ritual requires 10 turns, except for the fifth which requires 20. During these 10 turns, the player is 
				vulnerable, the forces of chaos will slip through and try to attack the player. The other races will also send intervention armies and try to stop
				the rituals. Completing all 5 rituals, will allow the player to fight the final battle on the Island of the Dead and claim the vortex.
