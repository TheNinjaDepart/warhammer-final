				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<p style="color: white; text-style: justify;">
				Its gameplay features players facing off against 
				AI players. The player can control their own empire and macro-manages its settlements, economy, technology, and diplomacy with AI empires.
				Players can also manage, move, and engage their armies which is a key function. All of these functions are turn-based.
				When armies engage they fight in a real time battle employing real time tactics. This part of the game 
				is more strategy and skill based and can heavily tax the player's micromanagement skills.

				<h2>Plot</h2>
				<p style="color: white; text-style: justify;">
				In the world of Warhammer, there exists a powerful magic maelstrom known only as the Vortex. The vortex was created long ago by the High Elves
				to siphon excess magic form the world and prevent the demons of Chaos to spread out into the world and destroy it. 
				however. However an omen comes in the form of a comet, and the major races see that the Vortex is becoming weak and unstable. 
				And so begins the race to claim the vortex, to unravel it, control it, or protect it. 4 races will duke it out in the battle of 
				the Vortex and only one will be the winner.
